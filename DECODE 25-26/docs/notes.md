4.1.1 Qualification Phase Performance
The calculation of Qualification Phase Performance points is done using the equation below. This equation is
an inverse error function which utilizes the following variables:
− R – the qualification rank of the team at the event at the conclusion of Qualification MATCHES (as
reported by the Event Management Software and defined in Section 13.6.3 Qualification
Ranking)
− N – the number of FIRST Tech Challenge teams participating in the Qualification rounds at the
event
− Alpha (α) – a static value (1.07) used to standardize the distribution of points at events
