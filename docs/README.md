# FTC HHS ROBOT BACKUPS
Hello programmers of the Future! Emma here (from the 2025-2026 arc). I have made this repository for easy use for people who need to make backups of their code, in the event of a horrific event in which all of the code "mysteriously" disappears.

## How to apply a new season to the repository
If you are working on a new season, create a new season by creating a new folder (create new document > "{name of season} - {date of season (in full)}/" and then name the most recent backup something on-topic.

## Make a fork of the repository!!
When you make your initial contribution, it'll automatically make a fork of the repository.
